In Doc Search UI
================

Search will be designed to provide instant results as soon as the user starts
typing in the search bar with a clean and minimal frontend.


Current Status of Doc Search
----------------------------

Currently we only provide basic search, i.e. user won't be able to see the results
until and unless the search form is not submitted.


Implementing The Backend
------------------------

We have a few options to support ``search as you type`` feature,
but we need to decide that which option would be best for our use-case.


1. Edge NGram Tokenizer
+++++++++++++++++++++++

According to the `official docs`_, ``edge_ngram`` tokenizer first breaks text down into words
whenever it encounters one of a list of specified characters,
then it emits N-grams of each word where the start of the N-gram is anchored to the beginning of the word.

For example: "Quick Foxes" will give the following tokens (3grams) - [ Qui, uic, ick, Fox, oxe, xes ].
Edge Ngram, will be something like NGram but only tokenize from the beginning.

For using it, we have to modify the :ref:`PageDocument <development/search:Elasticsearch Document>` mapping,
and make use of `multi-fields`_ feature of Elasticsearch.

Conclusion
~~~~~~~~~~

After experimenting with many different sample queries,
it can be said that edge-ngrams are very effective when it comes to ``search as you type`` feature.

It comes with its own set of pros and cons which are described below:

* Pros:

  * More effective than `Completion Suggester`_ when it comes to autocompleting
    words that can appear in any order.
  * It is considerable fast because most of the work is being done at index time,
    hence the time taken for autocompletion is reduced.

* Cons:

  * Need to modify existing mapping to implement it.
  * Need to configure manually as default settings of ``edge-ngrams`` tokenizer
    are almost entirely useless.
  * Different tokenizers are to be used when indexing/reindexing and when searching,
    but it can be specified at the indexing time.
