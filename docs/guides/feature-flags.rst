Feature Flags
=============

Read the Docs offers some additional flag settings which can be only be configured by the site admin.
These are optional settings and you might not need it for every project.
By default, these flags are disabled for every project.
A seperate request can be made by opening an issue on our `github`_ to enable
or disable one or more of these featured flags for a particular project.
