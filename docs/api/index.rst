Public API
==========

This section of the documentation details the public API
usable to get details of projects, builds, versions and other details
from Read the Docs.

.. warning::

    Originally, the Read the Docs API allowed connections over insecure HTTP.
    Starting in January 2019, requests over HTTP
    will be automatically redirected to HTTPS
    and non-GET/HEAD requests over insecure HTTP will fail.
