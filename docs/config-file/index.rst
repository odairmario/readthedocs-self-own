Configuration File
==================

Additionally to the admin panel of your project,
you can use a configuration file in the root of your project.
The main advantages of using a configuration file over the web interface are:

- Some settings are only avaliable using a configuration file
- The settings are per version rather than per project.
- The settings live in your VCS.

.. note::
   
   Using a configuration file is the recomended way of using Read the Docs,
   the web interface would be deprecated,
   old projects would be able to keep using the web interface.
