Connecting Your Account
-----------------------

If you are going to import repositories from GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab,
you should connect your Read the Docs account to your repository host first.
Connecting your account allows for:

* Easier importing of your repositories
* Automatically configure your repository :doc:`webhooks`
* Log into Read the Docs with your GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab credentials

To connect your account, go to your *Settings* dashboard and select *Connected
Services*. From here, you'll be able to connect to your GitHub, Bitbucket or GitLab
account. This process will ask you to authorize a connection to Read the Docs,
that allows us to read information about and clone your repositories.
