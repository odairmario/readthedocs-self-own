readthedocs.org is the largest open source documentation hosting service.
Today we:

* Serve over **55 million pages** of documentation a month
* Serve over **40 TB** of documentation a month
* Host over **80,000 open source projects** and support over **100,000 users**

Read the Docs is provided as a free service to the open source community,
